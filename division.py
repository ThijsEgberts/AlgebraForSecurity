    Solves the division with remainder of two numbers.
    Returns the quotient and the remainder in form [quotient, remainder]

    The algorithm is as follows:
    1. While x is greater or equal to y, subtract y from x.
    2. Add 1 to the quotient.
    3. Return the quotient and the remainder.

    This is based on Euclid's algorithm.
